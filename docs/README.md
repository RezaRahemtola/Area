# Area

Welcome to the documentation of Area üéâ\
Here you'll find everything you need to know about the project, its features and how to use it!

## What is it ‚ùì

Area is an automation platform, available as a web app and a mobile app, that allows you to
combine Actions and REactions [from a large range of integrations]((https://rezarahemtola.notion.site/Area-Integrations-f382af642ddb49d4b5a52e3fc307bfd9)) to fit your needs.

You can learn more about the project [here](general/project) üòÑ

## Getting started üöÄ

To start using our amazing platform, go to [`https://area.rezar.fr`](https://area.rezar.fr) and create your account to start creating workflows!\

If you want a more detailed guide of the different options to use Area (including self-hosted üíª), [check this page](general/getting-started).

## How it works ü§î

If you're here for the technical details, we got you covered too!
You can dive into the architecture documentation explaining how we are using [microservices](architecture/workers)
and a [supervisor](architecture/supervisor) to create Docker containers on-demand.

> üí° Some pretty standard parts may not be covered, but don't hesitate to reach out by creating an issue on [our repository](https://github.com/RezaRahemtola/Area), we'll be happy to help you!
