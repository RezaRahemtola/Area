# The project

Area is an automation platform, available as a web app and a mobile app, that allows you to
combine Actions and REactions [from a large range of integrations](https://rezarahemtola.notion.site/Area-Integrations-f382af642ddb49d4b5a52e3fc307bfd9) to fit your needs.

## Objectives and features ðŸ”¥

Once you register in Area (using either the web app or the mobile app), you can
start creating workflows ðŸš€\
Define an action, one or multiple reactions with their respective parameters, a name and you're good to go!

You can then view and modify your workflows in the library, change your settings (like the interface theme, the language ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸) or even browse the list of available integrations to imagine new workflows you could create!

Originally created as a [3rd Year Epitech project](/_assets/epitech-subject.pdf ':ignore'), as you can see it Area is now a production-ready platform with lots of features, and
we'll keep pushing this way to further enhance the user experience, number of integrations and requested features.
