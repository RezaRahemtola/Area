# Typescript project template
A simple template to easily start a clean Typescript project.

- [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) as the package manager
- [`prettier`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) to lint and enforce consistent style
- [`eslint`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) to improve code quality
  - Based on [`airbnb-typescript`](https://github.com/iamturns/eslint-config-airbnb-typescript) 
- [`dependabot`](https://github.com/dependabot) for automated dependency updates

## Installation

Simply install the dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

For the best experience you can also configure your IDE with additional settings and extensions.

> Look at the Typescript and extension sections of [my VSCode settings](https://github.com/RezaRahemtola/dotfiles/blob/main/vscode/settings.json)
>  for example 😉
